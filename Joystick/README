This is the implementation to use a Wii nunchuck to control the rover.


The nunchuck uses I2C to communicate with the Rpi.



This is an example on how to use all the functions of the nunchuck. 
Every time both buttons on it are pressed, the position of the joystick, the accelerometer and the buttons are printed to the console.

Note how the LCD and the nunchuck both use I2C. They, both, are a typical application of the I2C protocol, where the Rpi is the master for both devices as the slaves.
