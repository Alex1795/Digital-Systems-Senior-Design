# Digital-Systems-Senior-Design

Here are the software advances I have made for my final project design. 


The team of the project is formed by:

Alexander Davila (me) - Team Leader
Mateo Vasquez         - Software engineer
Alejandro Tejada      - Systems engineer
Rdolfo Leiva          - Hardware engineer

The webpage for the project is: https://engineering.purdue.edu/477grp5/

And my weekly report can be seen on: https://engineering.purdue.edu/477grp5/Team/progress/progress1.html


The description of the project as seen on the webpage:


  Hero bot:

    Hazardous Environment Remotely Operated (HERO) bot is a robotic system consisting of a mechanical arm mounted on a rover that will         mimic the user's arm movements. Additionally, the rover will warn the user when is close to fall off an edge. Finally, the rover will       also be able to trace back automatically to its original position at any time. The rover will be controlled through radio frequency         using an analog joystick where battery level and warning indicators will be placed.



I am mainly focused on the development of the controller using a Raspberry pi. 
All my code is written using Python. And all the code here is only made by me. 


This project is currently on development and I will keep adding more code when I have it.
