This is the application of the transparent mode for the Xbee module. The transparent mode allows to send raw data directly to the other module.

This method is less secure than the API mode but the use is more straight forward. 
This programs contains the inicializations as well as the main loop to 'listen' for any input and send an output constantly.

Both functions are straight forward and easy to use. Only two functions are necessary:

  serialPort.write([string to be sent]) # to send a string of characters to the xbee module.
  [received data] = serialPort.read()   # to listen for any incoming data.
