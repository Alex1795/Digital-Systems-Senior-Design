I did both implementatios in order to explore which is the most appropiate method to be used.
The API mode allows a more complex network and a more secure communication,
while the transparent mode can give a more direct and straight forward way to send and receive data.

The mode we pick will depend on how complex it will be to implement the API mode. 
Given that the package to send just one byte of data can be as big as 16 bytes on size. 
So far, we have tested succesfully the transparent mode using bothe the microcontroller and the Rpi.
I'll keep posting any change on software that I make.
